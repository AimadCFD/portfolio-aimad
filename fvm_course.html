    <h2>1. Introduction to Diffusion Problems</h2>
    <p>The Finite Volume Method (FVM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern physical processes such as heat conduction, fluid flow, and species transport. In this chapter, we focus on applying FVM to diffusion problems.</p>
    <p>The general form of the transport equation for a scalar property \(\phi\) (like temperature or concentration) is:</p>
    <pre>âˆ‚Ï†/âˆ‚t + âˆ‡Â·(uÏ†) = âˆ‡Â·(Î“âˆ‡Ï†) + S</pre>
    <p>Where:
        <ul>
            <li>Ï†: Scalar property (e.g., temperature or concentration)</li>
            <li>u: Velocity vector</li>
            <li>Î“: Diffusion coefficient</li>
            <li>S: Source term</li>
            <li>t: Time</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For steady-state diffusion, the equation simplifies to:</p>
    <pre>âˆ‡Â·(Î“âˆ‡Ï†) = 0</pre>

    <h2>2. FVM for One-Dimensional Steady-State Diffusion</h2>
    <p>Letâ€™s now look at the application of the Finite Volume Method for solving this equation in a one-dimensional domain. Consider a steady-state diffusion problem in a one-dimensional rod.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Mesh Generation</h3>
    <p>Divide the domain into control volumes, placing nodes at discrete points along the length of the rod. The faces of the control volumes are placed halfway between adjacent nodes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Discretization</h3>
    <p>The FVM involves integrating the governing equation over each control volume. For a one-dimensional diffusion problem, the discretized equation is:</p>
    <pre>a_W Ï†_W + a_E Ï†_E = a_P Ï†_P + S</pre>
    <p>Where:
        <ul>
            <li>Ï†_W, Ï†_E, Ï†_P: The values of Ï† at the west, east, and central nodes, respectively.</li>
            <li>a_W, a_E, a_P: The coefficients for the respective faces and central node, based on the diffusion coefficient Î“ and grid spacing.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Solution</h3>
    <p>After discretization, we have a system of algebraic equations that can be solved using suitable numerical methods (e.g., Gaussian elimination or iterative solvers).</p>

    <h2>3. FVM for Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Diffusion</h2>
    <p>The method used for one-dimensional problems can easily be extended to two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains.</p>

    <h3>Two-Dimensional Diffusion Equation</h3>
    <p>For a steady-state two-dimensional diffusion problem, the equation becomes:</p>
    <pre>Î“(âˆ‚Â²Ï†/âˆ‚xÂ² + âˆ‚Â²Ï†/âˆ‚yÂ²) = 0</pre>
    <p>The discretization involves contributions from the neighboring nodes in both x- and y-directions.</p>

    <h3>Three-Dimensional Diffusion Equation</h3>
    <p>For a steady-state three-dimensional diffusion problem, the equation is:</p>
    <pre>Î“(âˆ‚Â²Ï†/âˆ‚xÂ² + âˆ‚Â²Ï†/âˆ‚yÂ² + âˆ‚Â²Ï†/âˆ‚zÂ²) = 0</pre>
    <p>The discretization process involves contributions from the neighboring nodes in all three directions.</p>

    <h2>4. First Application: Heat Conduction in a Rod</h2>
    <p>Letâ€™s consider a simple application of the method to heat conduction in a rod. The rod has fixed temperatures at both ends, and we need to compute the steady-state temperature distribution along its length.</p>

    <h3>Governing Equation</h3>
    <p>The heat conduction equation in steady-state, with no source term, is:</p>
    <pre>dÂ²T/dxÂ² = 0</pre>
    
    <h3>Boundary Conditions</h3>
    <p>Given the following boundary conditions:
        <ul>
            <li>T(0) = 100Â°C (temperature at one end)</li>
            <li>T(L) = 500Â°C (temperature at the other end)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Mesh Generation</h3>
    <p>Discretize the length of the rod into \(N\) nodes, where \(L\) is the total length.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Discretization</h3>
    <p>Using the FVM, the discretized form of the temperature equation is:</p>
    <pre>a_W T_W + a_E T_E = a_P T_P</pre>
    <p>Where the coefficients are determined by the thermal conductivity \(k\) and the grid spacing \(dx\).</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Solution</h3>
    <p>The system of equations can be solved iteratively or using direct methods to obtain the temperature distribution \(T(x)\).</p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion and Applications</h2>
    <p>The Finite Volume Method is a versatile and effective approach for solving diffusion problems, particularly when dealing with complex geometries and boundary conditions. It can be applied to one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional problems, such as heat conduction in solids, species diffusion, and other transport phenomena.</p>
    <p>By discretizing the governing equations and solving the resulting algebraic system, FVM provides a powerful framework for numerical simulations in various engineering fields.</p>
